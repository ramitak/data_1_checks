# IMDB Top 250 Movies

## Description

This project is about the top Movies, The dataset contains the top 250 rated movies on IMDB as of 2021, providing a snapshot of the most popular and highly rated movies of recent times. This project shows the data's in different ways like it will show different lists of movies according to genre,ratings etc.

Features of this project:
1. The first feature would be that, it will be able to list out the movies accrding to the genre or year of realeases.

2. I will be using some funnctions in order to remove those movies list that were not rated or that does not have any ratings.

3. In this project, I will be also using some python functions like length to find out the length of that 
particular thing.

4. As data visualisation is also a part of this project, there will be matplotlib for visualising the dataset.

5. Lastly, there will be some description through markdown cells.

I have included all my requirements in (main.ipynb) file except the matkdown requirement. I have mentioned the markdown requirement which is requirement 5 in a seperate markdown_desc.ipynb file. Hope this makes sense.
